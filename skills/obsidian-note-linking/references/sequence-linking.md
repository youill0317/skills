# Sequence Linking

Use this guide when note filenames include numeric order prefixes.

## Recognized Patterns

- `0.Title`, `1.Title`, `2.Title`
- zero-padded variants like `01.Title`, `02.Title`
- hierarchical variants like `1.1Title`, `1.2Title`, `2.1Title`
- mixed examples such as `0.Overview`, `01.TeamProject`, `1.1WeeklyNotes`

## Parsing Rule

1. Extract leading numeric token before the first non-numeric/non-dot character.
2. Split token by dots into ordered levels.
   - `01` -> `[1]`
   - `1.1` -> `[1, 1]`
   - `0` -> `[0]`
3. Compare levels numerically, not lexicographically.

## Link Construction

For current note, recommend:

1. **Previous**: nearest lower note in same depth/track.
2. **Next**: nearest higher note in same depth/track.
3. **Parent**: immediate upper level note when depth > 1 (for `1.1`, parent candidate is `1.*`).
4. **Siblings**: notes sharing same parent prefix (for `1.1`, siblings are `1.2`, `1.3`, ...).
5. **Children**: optional when current is a parent index (`1` -> `1.1`, `1.2`).

## Placement Convention

Place sequence links at the bottom of each note in a dedicated block:

```markdown
---
## {navigation-heading}
- {previous-label}: [[Prev Note]]
- {next-label}: [[Next Note]]
- {parent-label}: [[Parent Note]]
- {related-label}: [[Sibling A]], [[Sibling B]]
```

Keep the documentation in English, but choose the rendered heading and labels to match the vault's dominant language or existing footer convention. Only include entries that can be verified from existing note names.

## Conflict Rules

- If both `1.Title` and `01.Title` exist, treat them as same numeric rank and prefer vault-dominant naming style.
- If ordering is ambiguous, return candidates with a short ambiguity note instead of guessing.
