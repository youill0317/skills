# Link Scoring Rubric

Use this rubric to rank candidate notes for Obsidian connection proposals.

## Score Dimensions (0-2 each)

1. **Topic overlap**
   - 0: Mostly unrelated
   - 1: Partial overlap
   - 2: Strong overlap with target note's central topic

2. **Complement value**
   - 0: Duplicates what target already says
   - 1: Adds minor nuance
   - 2: Adds clear context/evidence/contrast

3. **Actionability**
   - 0: Unclear why user should connect it
   - 1: Useful but optional
   - 2: Helps navigation, decisions, or next steps

4. **Vault fit**
   - 0: Off-pattern naming/tags or stale context
   - 1: Acceptable fit
   - 2: Strongly aligned with existing vault structure/conventions

5. **Connection precision**
   - 0: Only broad note-level relation is known
   - 1: Section-level target is plausible
   - 2: Heading/block/embed-level target is clearly justified

6. **Policy adherence**
   - 0: Breaks vault connection/tag policy
   - 1: Partially aligned with policy
   - 2: Fully aligned with active vault policy

## Ranking Guidance

- Default priority: total score descending.
- Tie-breakers:
  1. recency relevance (if user cares about current state),
  2. note specificity (prefer focused notes over generic hubs),
  3. backlink benefit (fills obvious graph gaps).

## Connection Type Selection

Choose the narrowest useful connection type:

1. `[[Note]]` for broad conceptual relation.
2. `[[Note#Heading]]` for section-specific context.
3. `[[Note#^block-id]]` for precise claim/quote reuse.
4. `![[Note]]` for inline reuse where visible embedding helps.
5. tags for cross-cutting themes or taxonomy alignment.

Always prefer the policy default form unless precision needs justify escalation.

## Hard Filters

Do not recommend a candidate when:

- The note existence/path is unverified.
- The relevance claim cannot be supported by inspected text.
- The candidate is only tangential and there are better alternatives.
