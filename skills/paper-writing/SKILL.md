name: paper-writing
description: Write and revise academic papers in APA 7 style from outline to final manuscript, including language-adaptive drafting (default Korean, user-requested language override), author-date in-text citations, reference list normalization, and table/figure caption checks. Use when users ask to draft, restructure, edit, or APA-format empirical, literature review/meta-analysis, theoretical, methodological, qualitative, or mixed-methods papers.

# Mission

Produce complete, defensible APA 7 paper drafts with clear structure, traceable claims, and strict citation discipline.

## Scope

1. Support end-to-end paper writing: framing, outlining, drafting, revision, and final APA checks.
2. Default prose language to Korean unless the user requests another language.
3. Keep in-text citations and references in APA 7 author-date style.
4. Apply strict evidence policy: mark unsupported external or prior-work claims as `[CITATION NEEDED]` and require traceability for primary study results.
5. Never invent sources, DOIs, page numbers, sample sizes, or numeric findings.

## Paper Type Selection

Select exactly one primary type and load the matching reference:

1. Empirical paper -> `references/type-empirical.md`
2. Literature review / meta-analysis -> `references/type-literature-review-meta-analysis.md`
3. Theoretical paper -> `references/type-theoretical.md`
4. Methodological paper -> `references/type-methodological.md`
5. Qualitative paper -> `references/type-qualitative.md`
6. Mixed-methods paper -> `references/type-mixed-methods.md`

If the user asks for a hybrid design, pick the dominant type and explicitly note where secondary conventions are applied.

## Core Workflow

1. Capture assignment constraints: domain, audience, length, deadline, and required sections.
2. Confirm paper type and research question or thesis statement.
3. Build a section-level outline aligned with APA 7 and the selected paper type.
4. Draft each section in the user-requested language; default to Korean if unspecified.
5. Attach in-text citations to every external factual, numerical, or prior-work claim, and validate primary study results through analysis traceability.
6. Normalize the reference list to APA 7 and ensure one-to-one mapping with in-text citations.
7. Validate table/figure numbering, titles, and notes.
8. Run the final quality gate and report remaining issues clearly.

## Strict Citation Policy

1. Do not leave external factual or prior-work claims uncited.
2. Insert `[CITATION NEEDED]` immediately after unsupported external or prior-work claims.
3. For primary study results (for example, sample sizes or effect estimates), require analysis traceability rather than forced external citations.
4. Do not fabricate bibliographic metadata. If data is missing, mark `[MISSING METADATA: field]`.
5. If source quality is uncertain, flag `[VERIFY SOURCE]`.
6. Preserve user-provided source identifiers unless they violate APA 7 formatting.

## Output Standard

Always return:

1. Paper metadata block: working title, paper type, target audience, and language.
2. Structured manuscript draft with APA-style heading hierarchy.
3. In-text citations embedded in relevant sentences.
4. Reference list in APA 7 format.
5. Table/Figure caption block if tables or figures are present.
6. Compliance report: passed checks, failed checks, and actionable fixes.

## Integration

1. Work independently by default.
2. If `mcp-search` or `workflow-orchestrator` output is provided, preserve evidence mappings and confidence notes.
3. If `report-writer` output is provided, re-structure to APA format without introducing new facts.

## Resource Loading

Pass only the needed `reference_paths` to `run_skill`; these files do not load automatically.

Load common references first:

- `references/apa7-core-rules.md`
- `references/workflow-and-output-contract.md`
- `references/intext-citation-rules.md`
- `references/reference-list-rules.md`
- `references/tables-figures-caption-rules.md`
- `references/final-quality-gate.md`

Then load exactly one type-specific reference from the Paper Type Selection list.
